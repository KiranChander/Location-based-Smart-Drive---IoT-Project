# Location-based-Smart-Drive---IoT-Project


Our suggested Smart Drive gives mobile workers, busy executives, and business owners greater freedom and flexibility by enabling users to access their hosted files from any online browser or mobile device. Employees can easily share files, give suggestions, and save changes thanks to the structure of our Smart Drive. The UX of this drive is made in such a way that it is simple to use. Users can just hit the link and begin uploading files. The portal interface area is available for user drag-and-drop operations. Depending on the current location (name of the city) of the devices, such as "Vancouver," "Surrey," "Victoria," "Burnaby," "Coquitlam," etc., the system will automatically place the files in separate folders (in a web server). If a new location is used, the system will automatically create a new folder for it and determine the location's city name to use as the folder name. If the system is unable to determine the city name, it will prompt the user to input city name (Folder name). After uploading, the system will confirm the user about the upload detail through a message (success/fail).
